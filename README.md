Problem statement:

Twitter has become and important communication channel in times of emergency, The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people announce an emergency they are observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter ( i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). However, identifying such tweets has always been a difficult task because of the ambiguity in the linguistic structure of the tweets and hence its always it is not always clear wether an individualâ€™s word are actually announcing the disaster.
